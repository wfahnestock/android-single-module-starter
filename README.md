# Jetpack Compose Android Single Module Starter
This is a single module and single activity starter project/template for an Android project using Jetpack Compose.

# Why?
I got tired of creating a new project and setting up the same boilerplate over and over again. So I decided to create a starter project that I can use as a template for my future projects.

# What's included?
This project includes the latest version of the following libraries:

- Jetpack Compose
- Jetpack Navigation
- Kotlin Serialization
- Kotlin Coroutines
- KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing, replaces Kapt)

# Current Build Status
